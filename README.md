Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) is one of the many applications of NLP. It is the technique for extracting subjective information from text or speech, such as opinions or attitudes. In other words, it involves classifying a text as positive or negative. 

A Machine Learning model with NLP has been used to perform the sentiment analysis through which, from a given tweet, we can classify whether the tweet is associated with positive or negative sentiment. The tweet which is conveying both positive and negative sentiment, whichever is stronger that should be taken.
